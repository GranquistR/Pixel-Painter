## Missing HTTPS Certificates

If there is an HTTPS certificate error when running 'npm run dev', manually creating the certificate might be needed.

1. Route to the 'Roaming' folder
2. Create a new folder called 'ASP.NET' if it is not already present
3. Create a new folder in ASP.NET called 'https'
4. Copy the directory of the 'https' folder
5. Open terminal and run the following command:
	'''
	dotnet dev-certs https --export-path 'your directory here'/mytestvueapp.client.pem 
	'''
